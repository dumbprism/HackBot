## Presenting Hackbot

This was my first experience creating a discord based bot where the sole purpose of the bot was to enable the user to fetch online and offline hackathons. I am currently trying to enhance this bot by implementing some AI models into it to make it more user friendly.

# Approach

The approach was quite simple where I used commands such as :

1. `/hello or /start` - to start the bot
2. `/on` - to fetch online hackathons
3. `/off` - to fetch offline hackathons
4. `/bye` - to end the bot 

I've used `discord.py` library that was useful in creating the commands. I have used web scraping to scrape data of online hackathons. Similarly for offline hackathons as well.

# Conclusion

Well I am looking forward to extend this project by using some optimization techniques and using some of the AI models and deploy it.
